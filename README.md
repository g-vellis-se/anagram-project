# Anagram Implementations in Java

In the given project, two anagram checker implementations (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) are provided.

Each implementation has a different time complexity.

More specifically, the `CharFreqAnagramCheckerImpl` has linear time complexity (i.e. O(n)), whereas the `SortBasedAnagramCheckerImpl` logarithmic (i.e. O(n log n)). 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `mvn clean compile`

Compiles the app.


### `mvn test`

Runs the app tests.
