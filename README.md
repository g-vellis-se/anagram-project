# Anagram Implementation using Java 

This is a Java maven project providing two implementations of the anagram algorithm (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram). 
The first implementation (see: CharFreqAnagramCheckerImpl) has linear time complexity (O(n)), whereas the second one (see: SortBasedAnagramCheckerImpl) logarithmic time complexity (i.e. O(n log n)).
